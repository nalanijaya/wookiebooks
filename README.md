# Wookie Books REST API

Wookie books REST API was implemented using .net core 2.2 and Visual Studio 2017. This enables swagger and postman testing. The docker build had some issues with nuget.

1. For POSTMAN end point testing, export Wookie Books.postman_collection.json file located in WookieBooks.API folder.

# Note
At the moment I am sending the link to the repository, I was in the middle of troubleshooting the following error in my docker build. As it is taking time, I would like to send the work I have done upto now.
